# 8BitPongGame
Fall 2023 SOFIA Project at Monmouth College

Over the course of 3 weeks, my group and I followed a tutorial from Ben Eater and built his 6502 computer (https://eater.net/6502).
Once the build was completed, we then set our sights on making a small game within the computer. We chose to make a simple Pong game.
With many limitations, we were able to successfully make a 2 lane Pong game on our small LCD display, which included a "ball", 2 paddles being controlled by 2 people with a button, and a score counter, which ended the game after a couple of points were scored. 

Overall, this was an interesting introduction to computer hardware and programming in assembly, and my group and I had a lot of fun building the computer and programming it in cool and interesting ways
